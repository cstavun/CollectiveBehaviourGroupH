## Introduction : 
We were looking for an article that highlighted the collective behavior of ants, in which we were interested because we found their group behavior impressive. We settled for this paper : "An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant" by Adam L. Conin. Not only does it explain single ants behaviour, but it also studies how individual parameters lead to collective decisions, in particular during househunting, in a mass-recruting ant species. 


## Starting point :
"An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant" - research paper by Adam Colin from October 2018 : 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519318303175?casa_token=0QGBiNCPEHwAAAAA:uuc350JLVjmPiYZWk9JuRsnalEOcBd7Qo73Nmcod5xDX2yM3wn0349G9GgVh8xDD6Cx--Bq7_Q


## Steps of the project : 
**Phase 1 : recreating the model presented in the paper.** 
The model aims to replicate the natural behavior of these ants during nest-site selection. The ants rely on pheromone trails for navigation and recruitment and use quorum thresholds for collective decisions. The agent-based model described in the paper was constructed using NetLogo, employing a stochastic and spatially explicit approach, with a specific emphasis on trail-based recruitment. 

**Phase 2:  test of the model through different parameters.**
The paper investigates a range of parameters and environmental factors to understand the dynamics of the ants collective behavior. We will reproduce these tests and also explore additional parameters to assess whether the model can be improved and, if so, how it could be enhanced. 

**Phase 3 : expend the model to another area.**
Finally, we will try to use the model to explain or solve problems in other areas where a group of agents needs to find and choose the best option from a set of alternatives. While further research is necessary, at first glance, we've identified a couple of problems that could potentially be addressed using the ant nest site selection model: 
- routing traffic in a computer network
- scheduling tasks in a factory
- finding the shortest path between two points in a graph



## Expected timeline :

Here is how we plan to carry out this project.

Phase 1 : 23/10/2023 - 19/11/2023
During this phase, we will conduct extensive research on the subject to gain a general understanding of how ant-based models work and explore existing models in this area. Simultaneously, we will install all the necessary tools for implementing the model. Additionally, we aim to develop the initial version of our model.
*19th November 2023 : First report* 

Phase 2 : 19/11/2023 - 17/12/2023
During these weeks, we will test our model's accuracy with various parameters. Thanks to these tests, we'll be able to improve the model.
*17th December 2023 : Second report* 

Phase 3 : 17/12/2023 - 07/01/2024
This phase includes time for addressing any potential delays from the previous phase and optimizing the model. 
Depending on the remaining time, we will explore applications of the model to other problems and conduct tests to assess its efficacy.
*7th January 2024 : Last report*
