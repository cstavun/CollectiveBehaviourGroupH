## Introduction : 
We were looking for an article which highlight the collective behavior of ants which interested us as we found their group behaviour impressive. We settled for this paper : "An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant". Not only does it explain single ants behaviour, but it also studies how individual parameters lead to collective decisions, in particular during househunting in a mass-recruting ant species. 


## Starting point :
"An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant" - research paper by Adam Colin from October 2018 : 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519318303175?casa_token=0QGBiNCPEHwAAAAA:uuc350JLVjmPiYZWk9JuRsnalEOcBd7Qo73Nmcod5xDX2yM3wn0349G9GgVh8xDD6Cx--Bq7_Q


## Steps of the project : 
**Phase 1 : recreating the model presented in the paper.** 
The model aims to replicate the natural behavior of these ants during nest-site selection. The ants rely on pheromone trails for navigation and recruitment and use quorum thresholds for collective decisions. The agent-based model is the paper was built in NetLogo, taking a stochastic and spatially explicit approach, with a focus on trail-based recruitment. 

**Phase 2:  test of the model through different parameters.**
The paper investigates a range of parameters and environmental factors to understand the dynamics of the ants collective behavior. We will reproduce these test and also try other parameters to see if the model can be improved and if so, how.

**Phase 3 : expend the model to another area.**
Finally, we will try to use the model to explain solve problems in other areas where a group of agents needs to find and choose the best option from a set of alternatives. We'll need to do more research but upon first look here are a couple of problems that could be solved using the ant nest site selection model : 
- routing traffic in a computer network
- scheduling tasks in a factory
- finding the shortest path between two points in a graph



## Expected timeline :

Here is how we plan to carry out this project.

Phase 1 : 23/10/2023 - 19/11/2023
We will first make several research on the subject. We need to have a general understanding of how ants based models work and what research has already been done in this area. 

* 19th November 2023 : First report  
 We need to understand the general idea and to look at the different parameters to consider. Thus, we will be able to provide a first framework of a model depicting the nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting an.

* 17th December 2023 : Second report  
The first step will allow us to establish a clear model and to implement it in Python. This part will probably be the most difficult one, as we’ll have to try different methods and to implement concretely what we have learn from our research. It will also be the occasion to think about some tests we will do later for verification of the model. 

* 7th January 2024 : Last report  
Our last report will present our general work, with the main research we’ve done, the methodology we used, the model we implemented, the test we’ve done, and a discussion about the use of solution we gave and what could be improved.
