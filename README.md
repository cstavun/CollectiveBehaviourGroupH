## Starting point :
"An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant" - research paper by Adam Colin from October 2018

## Goals of the project : 
We have search – and find - an article which highlight a collective behavior among ants.
Indeed, all of us wanted to study animals and more specifically ants, as their behavior as a group is impressive. One of us was also interested by the influence of a group in decision-making during a vote. At the end, we found the perfect paper : "An agent-based model of nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting ant". Not only does it explain ants behaviour, but it also studies how individual parameters lead to make a collective decision. --> Results of the research paper show "how an individual-based algorithm based on mass-recruiting ants can emulate a complex and collective biological process over a range of scenarios. It studies how numerous individual-level components contribute to the collective decision process during househunting in a mass-recruiting ant species"  (copy/past of the article : need to be reformulated) !!)


## Expected timeline :

Here is how we plan to carry out this project.

* 19th November 2023 : First report
We will first make several research on the subject. We need to understand the general idea and to look at the different parameters to consider. Thus, we will be able to provide a first framework of a model depicting the nest-site selection in a mass-recruiting an.

* 17th December 2023 : Second report
The first step will allow us to establish a clear model and to implement it in Python. This part will probably be the most difficult one, as we’ll have to try different methods and to implement concretely what we have learn from our research. It will also be the occasion to think about some tests we will do later for verification of the model. 

* 7th January 2024 : Last report
Our last report will present our general work, with the main research we’ve done, the methodology we used, the model we implemented, the test we’ve done, and a discussion about the use of solution we gave and what could be improved.
